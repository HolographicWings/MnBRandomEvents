They also seemed to load up pieces of the nearby flora as if taking samples for study. After a few minutes the vessel leaves without a sound towards the sky. The soldier who returned from this ordeal was a trusted man whom you are inclined to believe. You tell him to go get some food and go to bed. As he is heading towards his tent he suddenly bends over and starts vomiting violently. He then falls to the ground in agony while blood is flowing from all his facial orifices. You grab a sword and put him out of his misery and order your men to burn his body at once. When you return to your tent you are shaking. You try to make a note of this event in your diary but you find yourself too distraught to write anything. You ponder the question of who or what could have killed your men like this.

The surviving soldier, a reliable and trusted member of your team, seemed genuinely shaken. Believing his account, you instruct him to eat and rest. As he heads to his tent, he suddenly doubles over, violently vomiting. Within moments, he collapses in excruciating pain, blood streaming from his eyes, nose, and mouth. You swiftly end his suffering with your sword and order an immediate cremation of his body. Returning to your tent, a sense of dread overwhelms you. You attempt to document the harrowing incident in your diary, but find yourself too unsettled to write coherently.

The returned soldier, known for his honesty, was visibly distressed. Trusting his testimony, you advise him to eat and sleep. However, as he moves towards his tent, he suddenly starts to retch violently, then falls, blood oozing from his facial orifices. Acting quickly, you mercifully kill him with your sword and command your men to burn the body without delay. Back in your tent, you're visibly shaken.

Tragically, as he walks to his tent, he is overtaken by violent vomiting and collapses, blood pouring from every facial opening. You end his agony swiftly with your sword and order an immediate cremation of his body. Shaken, you return to your tent, struggling to process the day's events.

There, in a haunting display, she vanishes, leaving behind a cold, eerie energy. Your group, enveloped in a mix of awe and fear, returns to camp, the silence between you speaking volumes. Gathering around the dying embers of the campfire, you debate the significance of this otherworldly encounter. Resolving to unearth the mystery, you lead a somber expedition back to the tree at dawn.

Her pained expression and the memory of her eerie scream stay with you, banishing any hope of sleep." />
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_2D" text="Bracing yourself, you gently say 'hello' into the calm of the night. The ghost-like woman unleashes a scream so chilling and surreal it seems to shake the very air. Then, she's nowhere to be seen, her cry echoing hauntingly.

    <!-- Event Choice 3 -->
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_3A" text="Panicked as if chased by a horde of Sea Raiders, you leap from your bed, arms flailing, and bolt out the door like a shot arrow. Your mad sprint through the camp is a blur of tents and startled faces. As you skid to a halt by the campfire, you're a wild-eyed, breathless mess, hastily explaining about a ghostly apparition in your tent. Your men burst into uncontrollable laughter. One of them, a veteran with a scarred face, mimics your terrified expression, 'Did the ghost threaten to steal your boots?' he jests, while another, a younger recruit, starts a playful chant, 'Brave {heroName}, scared of the dark!' They laugh heartily, clinking their ale mugs, as you stand there, your fear slowly turning into a sheepish grin. The night continues with exaggerated reenactments of your 'brave escape', your men finding endless amusement in your uncharacteristic dash." />
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_3B" text="You catapult out of your bed as if a bandit lord was on your heels, your feet barely touching the ground in your frantic escape. The entire camp seems to whirl past as you sprint straight to the campfire. Gasping for air, you recount the terrifying encounter with what seemed like a ghost. The men fall into fits of laughter. 'Was the ghost armed? Did you win the duel?' one asks between chuckles. Another, a grizzled sergeant, pretends to be frightened by his shadow, sending the group into another uproar. Jokes about recruiting ghosts for your next siege or sending you on a 'ghost patrol' fill the air. As the night wears on, your tale of terror becomes a campfire legend, embellished with each retelling, much to the delight of your troops." />
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_3C" text="With a shriek that echoes through the camp, you leap from your bed as if it were on fire and make a beeline for the door, sprinting as though leading a desperate charge against Swadian knights. You stumble into the campfire area, a mix of fear and confusion. Out of breath, you explain about a ghostly figure in your tent. The men erupt in laughter. One of them, a jester at heart, grabs a blanket and starts floating around, imitating your ghost. 'Look out, our commander will desert us for a ghost,' he cackles. Another pats your back, 'Don’t worry, we’ll stand guard tonight, lest the scary ghost returns!' he says with a wink. The rest of the evening is filled with light-hearted banter and mock ghost stories, each more outrageous than the last, as you join in the laughter, your initial fear dissolving into the warm camaraderie of your men." />
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_3D" text="In a frenzy that rivals a villager escaping raiders, you jump from your bed and hurtle through the camp. Dodging tents and a snoozing hound, you arrive at the campfire, a picture of wide-eyed panic. Breathlessly, you recount your ghostly encounter, expecting some empathy. Instead, your comrades erupt with laughter. One jokes heartily, 'Scared more than a peasant at tax time!' while another breaks into a playful song about ghostly pursuits. The night turns into an uproar of jests and light-hearted teasing, suggestions of a ghost hunt adding to the merriment. As the fire crackles and stars shimmer, laughter fills the air, your spectral scare now a favorite tale among your fellow soldiers." />
    <string id="SupernaturalEncounter_Event_Choice_3E" text="Like a deer startled by an arrow, you bound from your bed and race through the camp with the speed of a fleeing looter. Your dramatic entrance at the campfire, where your men lounge leisurely, is met with surprise. Out of breath, you recount your ghostly encounter, expecting a mix of awe and concern. Instead, your men can't hold back their laughter. A gruff soldier knight jests, 'Did you challenge the ghost to a duel, or were you too busy running?' Another playfully peers into the darkness, pretending to spot a whole army of ghosts. The mood lightens as they tease you about enlisting ghosts for your next campaign. Amidst chuckles and friendly jibes, your eerie experience turns into a source of mirth, bringing a light-hearted end to the evening under the starlit Calradian sky." />

Do you decide to aid her pursuit of a happier future, or do you let her succumb to the harsh demands of her noble birth?" />

    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_1AA" text="You choose the rooftops for their vantage point and relative secrecy. As the city's lights flicker below, you and {noblewomanName} navigate the skyline with careful precision. Each leap and dash across the tiled roofs is calculated, avoiding areas lit by torches or moonlight. You occasionally pause, ensuring no curious eyes spot your silhouettes against the night sky. After a heart-racing journey across the city, you finally reach a secluded part of the wall, where a hidden ladder allows for a safe descent. Once on the ground, {noblewomanName} reveals a small, hidden pouch and hands it to you, the coins inside amounting to {goldReward}. Her eyes glisten with unshed tears as she thanks you, then turns to disappear into the night, her spirit unburdened by the shackles of her past." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_1AB" text="In this meticulously planned escape, you arrange for a merchant's cart, laden with goods, to leave the city at dusk. {noblewomanName} is concealed among the cargo, disguised as a simple crate. You adopt the role of a merchant, sharing light banter with the city guards as they inspect the cart. They laugh at your jokes, unaware of the precious 'goods' you're smuggling out. Once through the gates, the tension that had built up in your chest eases. Several miles from the city, you help {noblewomanName} out of her cramped hiding place. She stretches, relief flooding her face, and gratefully hands you a hefty pouch containing {goldReward}. With a final, hopeful glance back at the city walls that once confined her, she sets off into the night, towards a future of her own making." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_1AC" text="Timing the escape with the city's annual festival, you and {noblewomanName} merge into the crowd of revelers. The city is alive with music and laughter, providing the perfect cover. You guide her through the maze of celebration, using the dense crowd to shield her from the gaze of patrolling guards. At the height of the festivities, when the sky bursts into colors with fireworks, you quicken your pace. The gates are less guarded, the guards' attention diverted. Once safely beyond the city, {noblewomanName} reveals a purse filled with {goldReward} as a token of her immense gratitude. She watches the distant fireworks one last time, a symbol of her own liberation, before disappearing into the embrace of the night." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_1AD" text="The forgotten underground passage, a remnant of ancient times, serves as your escape route. You and {noblewomanName} navigate its damp corridors, guided by the flickering torchlight. The passage is suffocatingly narrow in places, and you often have to proceed single file. Echoes of your footsteps are your constant companions, creating an eerie rhythm in the otherwise silent tunnel. When you finally emerge into the open air, a sense of liberation fills the atmosphere. {noblewomanName} reaches into her cloak and retrieves a well-hidden bag of coins, amounting to {goldReward}, and hands it to you with a mixture of relief and joy. She takes a deep breath of the free night air, then steps away from the city and the life she's leaving behind, her steps light with newfound hope and freedom." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_1AE" text="The river, a silent ally in your plan, promises a discreet escape route. The small boat you've arranged rocks gently in the water as you and {noblewomanName}, dressed as humble fishermen, row away from the city. The rhythm of the oars slicing through the water is soothing, and the further you get from the city, the more {noblewomanName}'s tense shoulders relax. The journey is long, winding through the quiet countryside under the cover of darkness. At a remote landing, far from the prying eyes of the city, you part ways. {noblewomanName} hands you a substantial purse, heavy with {goldReward}, her eyes shining with tears of gratitude. She steps onto the bank, a free woman at last, her heart full of dreams and possibilities." />

    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_1BA" text="Your plan to traverse the city via its rooftops starts with promise, but as you and {noblewomanName} deftly navigate the maze of moonlit roofs, a guard spots your movements. The alarm is raised quickly, echoing through the night. Despite your efforts to evade the pursuing guards, a misstep by {noblewomanName} leads to her capture. You manage to escape by scaling down a wall and disappearing into a narrow alley, but the knowledge that she has been taken by the guards, her dreams of freedom crushed, leaves you with a sense of deep failure." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_1BB" text="Disguised as a simple merchant, you drive the cart with {noblewomanName} hidden beneath the goods. The tension rises as you approach the city gates. Suddenly, the guards, spurred by a suspicion or perhaps routine, decide to search the cart more thoroughly.

You blend into the nearby crowd, narrowly avoiding capture, but the plan's failure and {noblewomanName}'s capture weigh heavily on your conscience." />

Guards swarm the area, and in the chaos, {noblewomanName} is caught. You manage to evade capture by quickly blending into a group of performers, but the regret of leaving her behind taints your narrow escape." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_1BD" text="The ancient underground passage, once a beacon of hope, turns into a trap. A routine patrol, unexpected and untimely, blocks your path. Cornered and outnumbered, a brief struggle ensues. In the confusion, you find a momentary gap and slip away through a narrow offshoot tunnel. However, {noblewomanName} is not so lucky. She is apprehended by the guards. Your escape through the damp and echoing tunnels is haunted by the thought of her now being in the hands of those she sought to flee." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_1BE" text="The plan to escape by river starts smoothly as you row the small boat away from the city. But as you approach the city limits, a patrol boat, an unforeseen hindrance, intercepts you. In a desperate bid for freedom, you dive into the river, using the cover of night and the water's flow to escape. However, {noblewomanName} is unable to follow suit and is captured by the patrol. You reach the shore, drenched and safe, but the escape's failure and her capture leave you grappling with guilt and frustration." />

    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_2AA" text="In a quiet corner of the city, you speak with {noblewomanName}, offering words of wisdom.

She can't see past the immediate unhappiness of her situation, and your suggestions of long-term strategy fall on deaf ears. She departs from the conversation with a heavy heart, her mind set on the immediate dread of her pending nuptials." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_2BC" text="You attempt to inspire {noblewomanName} with words about finding inner strength and the hidden power in adversity. However, your pep talk fails to resonate with her. She is too overwhelmed by the reality of her situation to consider the possibility of personal growth through hardship. She leaves the conversation feeling more isolated and misunderstood, her belief in a brighter future further diminished." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_2BD" text="In your conversation with {noblewomanName}, you highlight the influential power she could wield as a noblewoman. But she views your ideas with skepticism. She struggles to see how she could possibly sway the baron or effect any meaningful change in her constrained position. Disheartened, she dismisses your suggestions as unrealistic, leaving the conversation with her sense of entrapment and helplessness intact." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_2BE" text="You speak to {noblewomanName} about the opportunities for personal growth that her situation presents. However, she meets your ideas with disdain. The thought of personal development pales in comparison to her immediate dread of the marriage. She cannot fathom enduring the union for the sake of growth. She departs from your meeting feeling even more trapped, viewing your conversation as a series of well-meaning but ultimately hollow platitudes." />

    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_3AA" text="Your decision not to intervene is coupled with a heartening talk about finding inner courage and facing life's challenges. Initially, {noblewomanName} feels a wave of disappointment, but as your conversation progresses, she starts to see things differently. You share stories of resilience and the power of self-belief, which gradually shift her perspective. By the end of your discussion, she finds an inner strength she didn't realize she had. She leaves with a sense of purpose and a plan to approach her situation not as a victim but as a woman in control of her destiny." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_3AB" text="Although you refuse direct assistance, you spend time instilling a sense of self-belief in {noblewomanName}. You emphasize the importance of confidence and self-reliance in overcoming life’s hurdles. She listens intently, her initial dismay giving way to a contemplative state. Your words strike a chord, and by the end of the exchange, she's visibly uplifted. She departs with a new mindset, determined to use her situation as a platform to grow stronger and more independent." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_3AC" text="While you decline to help {noblewomanName} escape, you encourage her to take a proactive approach to her life. You discuss how adversity can be a powerful motivator and catalyst for change. Though disheartened at first, she gradually opens up to the idea of facing her challenges head-on. Your conversation plants seeds of determination and resolve, leading her to leave with a renewed spirit, ready to take charge of her life and turn obstacles into opportunities." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_3AD" text="You choose not to help {noblewomanName} flee but instead guide her towards self-discovery. You talk about the power of understanding one’s own strengths and using them to navigate difficult situations. As she absorbs your words, a visible change occurs. She starts to see her impending marriage not as an end but as a new beginning, a chance to assert herself and influence her surroundings. Empowered by this realization, she sets forth, ready to explore and utilize her newfound understanding of herself." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_3AE" text="In denying her request for help, you focus on fostering her sense of independence and resilience. You share insights into how challenging situations can be transformed into platforms for personal growth and self-assertion. Initially, {noblewomanName} appears crestfallen, but as the conversation unfolds, she begins to resonate with your perspective. Inspired by your belief in her capabilities, she leaves feeling energized and ready to face her future with a resilient and independent spirit." />

    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_3BA" text="In your conversation with {noblewomanName}, you express your decision not to assist her directly, instead offering guidance to find inner fortitude. However, your words seem to exacerbate her feelings of despair. She listens, but the hope in her eyes dims with each passing moment. She had come seeking a lifeline, but instead, she feels as if she’s been handed an anchor. The conversation, intended to empower her, ironically leaves her feeling more powerless and resigned to her fate than before. As she departs, the weight of her situation seems to press down on her even more heavily, leaving a shadow of the vibrant person she once was." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_3BB" text="Your refusal to aid her escape, coupled with a speech about self-reliance, is taken by {noblewomanName} not as encouragement, but as dismissive and insensitive. She hears your words, but they sound hollow to her, echoing in the void of her despair. She responds with a bitter edge to her voice, a sharp contrast to the gentle plea she had initially brought to you. Feeling misunderstood and let down, she leaves with a sense of betrayal and a jaded view of seeking help, her trust in others deeply shaken." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_3BC" text="When you decline to help {noblewomanName}, aiming instead to inspire her to draw upon her own resilience, she takes it as a clear sign of your unwillingness to understand her plight. Her expression falls, a visible representation of her crumbling hope. The conversation, rather than lifting her spirits, pushes her further into a feeling of isolation. As she turns to leave, there’s a palpable sense of loss – not just of her hopes of escaping her situation but also of her belief in compassion and empathy from others." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_3BD" text="As you suggest to {noblewomanName} that she find strength in herself, she struggles to find comfort in your words. Instead of feeling empowered, she feels more anxious and scared. The conversation heightens her fears, turning them into near-tangible phantoms that loom larger in her mind. She leaves feeling overwhelmed by the magnitude of her predicament, her steps faltering and her resolve crumbling under the weight of her impending marriage." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_3BE" text="Your well-meaning advice on self-reliance and inner strength falls on deaf ears as {noblewomanName} finds herself unable to connect with the optimism and hope you try to instill. She had hoped for a savior, but instead, she finds herself facing a mirror reflecting her own helplessness. The conversation leaves her spiraling further into despair, convinced now more than ever that her situation is a dark, inescapable well. She leaves not with a renewed sense of purpose, but with a heavy heart, her spirit sinking under the burden of her unavoidable future." />

    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_4AA" text="You set up a meeting with {noblewomanName}'s family under the guise of discussing her future. Utilizing your high steward skill, you meticulously lay out the benefits of aligning their house with a more compatible, yet equally prestigious, noble family. You argue not just for {noblewomanName}'s happiness, but also for the strategic advantages a different alliance would bring. Your persuasive eloquence and detailed knowledge of noble lineages make a strong impression. After intense deliberation, her family concedes to your insightful proposal.

You arrange a meeting with her family and present your findings, emphasizing the long-term happiness and stability this match could provide. The family, convinced by your thorough research and thoughtful matchmaking, consents to this new engagement. For your exceptional matchmaking skills, they gratefully bestow upon you a reward of {goldReward}." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_4AD" text="In your meeting with {noblewomanName}'s family, you bring an old but significant alliance to their attention, one that had been beneficial in the past but had since lapsed. You suggest this alliance could be rekindled and strengthened through a new marital bond with {noblewomanName}. You outline the mutual benefits, the shared history, and the potential for renewed cooperation and prosperity between the two houses. Your knowledge of historical alliances and your ability to project these benefits into future gains resonate well with her family. Seeing the wisdom in your proposal, they agree to pursue this renewed alliance. Impressed by your historical insight and strategic thinking, they reward your efforts with a generous sum of {goldReward}." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_4AE" text="In your negotiation with {noblewomanName}'s family, you emphasize the importance of looking to the future. You propose a marriage alliance with a family known for its progressive stance, aligning well with {noblewomanName}'s own modern views and her aspiration for a more meaningful life.

You discuss how this alliance could open up new opportunities and set a precedent for future generations. Captivated by your vision of a forward-looking union, her family agrees to your innovative proposal. In appreciation of your foresight and the promising future you’ve helped to secure, they present you with a significant reward of {goldReward}." />

    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_4BA" text="During a formal negotiation session with {noblewomanName}'s family, you meticulously present a well-crafted argument for a more suitable marital match, emphasizing mutual benefits and long-term happiness. Despite your eloquent speech and strategic insights, her family remains staunchly unyielding. They view your suggestions as unnecessary interference in their affairs. The conversation grows heated as they staunchly defend their decision, and you realize that they are not open to outside influence. The meeting concludes abruptly with you being escorted out by guards, leaving you reflecting on the failed negotiation and the potential damage to your rapport with a key noble house." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_4BB" text="You approach {noblewomanName}'s family with confidence, proposing an alternative suitor who would be a more compatible match. However, instead of interest, your proposal is met with immediate and intense hostility. The family, deeply offended by what they perceive as a challenge to their authority, accuses you of overstepping your boundaries. Despite your attempts to diffuse the situation and explain your rationale, the atmosphere becomes increasingly hostile. The meeting ends with you being forcefully removed, a clear sign that not only has the negotiation failed, but it has also potentially incited animosity from a powerful family." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_4BC" text="With the intent to offer a mutually beneficial alternative, you present your proposal to {noblewomanName}'s family. However, your ideas are grossly misinterpreted. The family, taking umbrage at what they perceive as an insinuation of their poor judgment, reacts defensively. Your attempts to steer the conversation back on track are in vain as they grow increasingly indignant. The dialogue escalates quickly, culminating in accusations of disrespect and meddling. The meeting concludes with you being briskly ushered out, leaving you to contemplate the abrupt and harsh dismissal and its implications for your future dealings." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_4BD" text="You enter the negotiation with a clear strategy, advocating for a marriage alliance that you believe would be more beneficial for all involved. Unfortunately, your approach is met with unexpected resistance. The family, offended by your attempt to influence their decision, questions your understanding of their values and traditions. The discussion takes a turn for the worse, with the family expressing their displeasure at your audacity to suggest an alternative. The tense meeting ends with a stern warning for you to refrain from such overtures in the future, and you're escorted out, realizing that your well-intentioned strategy has led to a diplomatic strain." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_4BE" text="With a vision of a progressive and beneficial union, you meet with {noblewomanName}'s family to present your innovative proposal. However, the family is entrenched in traditional views and is not receptive to your modern ideas. They dismiss your proposal as too avant-garde and risky, refusing to deviate from their established plans. Displeased with your unorthodox approach, they bring the meeting to an abrupt close. You're shown the door with a clear message that your forward-thinking proposals are unwelcome, leaving you to ponder the conservative nature of the nobility and the possible repercussions for your reputation among them." />

    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_5A" text="In a secluded and dimly lit part of the city, you confront {noblewomanName} with a sadistic glee. You begin with a display of raw physical power, inflicting pain through calculated strikes, each blow a message of your control and her helplessness. As she cowers, you lean in, whispering detailed threats about the horrors and tortures that await her and her loved ones if she dares to defy. The combination of your physical brutality and the horrific future you paint breaks her. She nods in submission, traumatized and defeated." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_5B" text="You ambush {noblewomanName} in an isolated area, where your violent outburst leaves no room for doubt or hope. Your fists and words are weapons, each strike accompanied by verbal assaults, crushing her dignity and resolve. As you see her spirit crumble under the assault, you reinforce the inevitability of her situation. Her acquiescence comes not out of agreement but from a place of utter despair and brokenness, a direct result of your merciless attack." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_5C" text="In an abandoned building, you subject {noblewomanName} to a night of relentless mental and physical torture. You methodically alternate between inflicting pain and instilling fear, breaking down her will to resist. Each act of violence is designed to show her the futility of defiance and the depth of your cruelty. By morning, she is a shell of herself, agreeing to anything in a desperate bid to end her suffering." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_5D" text="You lure {noblewomanName} to a place where you've staged a brutal demonstration of your power. You coldly execute a series of actions designed to instill a deep-seated fear of your capabilities. She watches, horror-struck, as you demonstrate what happens to those who cross you. The display leaves her in no doubt about the severity of her situation. Shaken to the core, she agrees to the marriage, her will to resist completely extinguished." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_5E" text="You orchestrate {noblewomanName}'s abduction to a hidden location where she is kept captive. Over several days, you visit her, each time using physical force and menacing threats to erode her resolve. Isolated and subjected to regular bouts of violence, her hope diminishes with each passing hour. When you finally offer her the chance to end her ordeal by agreeing to the marriage, she does so, seeing it as her only escape from the nightmare you've created." />

    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_6A" text="Deep in the secluded wilderness, you lead {noblewomanName} under the false hope of escape. As the desolation of the surroundings becomes apparent, you reveal your true, malevolent self. Her initial shock turns to abject terror as you relish in describing the fate you have planned for her. You proceed to inflict a series of calculated, cruel tortures, each methodically designed to maximize her suffering and fear. Her cries of agony and betrayal fill the air, a twisted symphony to your ears. You prolong her torment, savoring each moment of her despair, before finally, in a barbaric act, you end her life. You leave her in an unmarked grave, her last moments a prolonged ordeal of merciless cruelty." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_6B" text="In the eerie silence of ancient ruins, {noblewomanName} faces the horrifying reality of your betrayal. What starts as a promise of liberation quickly turns into a nightmare. You take perverse pleasure in slowly dismantling her hopes, replacing them with the terror of impending doom. Each of your actions is more brutal and heartless than the last, as you push the boundaries of cruelty. Her suffering under your hands is prolonged and excruciating, her screams echoing off the forgotten walls. Her life ends not with a swift act but a drawn-out, savage display of your darkest desires, leaving her broken body as a testament to your heinous deed." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_6C" text="At the river's edge, the moonlight casts a sinister glow as you enact your deceitful plan. With a smile, you push {noblewomanName} into the frigid waters. As she struggles, the realization of your treachery overwhelms her. You watch with cold detachment as her struggle turns to desperation. Her attempts to cling to life become weaker, each gasp for air a fading hope. You ensure her demise is not quick; her drawn-out battle with the river becomes a spectacle of your cruelty. Finally, as the river claims her, you leave, her demise a dark secret swallowed by the waters." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_6D" text="The abandoned warehouse becomes a chamber of horrors as you reveal your monstrous intentions to {noblewomanName}. Each word you utter is laced with venom, each action a calculated assault on her body and spirit. You methodically break her, physically and mentally, enjoying the crescendo of her screams.

The warehouse reverberates with the sounds of your savagery until finally, you silence her permanently, her life ending in a crescendo of cruelty." />
    <string id="FleeingFate_Event_Choice_6E" text="In a dank, forgotten cellar, you bring {noblewomanName} to face a fate worse than death. The chilling realization of your betrayal is just the beginning of her nightmare. You unleash upon her a series of inhuman tortures, each more depraved and gruesome. Her pain and fear fuel your malevolence, her screams a melody to your dark soul. You drag out her suffering, inflicting wound upon wound, breaking her in body and mind. When you finally grant her release from the torment, it's in a manner so brutal and merciless that it extinguishes all that she once was. Her end is a slow, agonizing descent into oblivion, marked by your unrelenting malice." />
